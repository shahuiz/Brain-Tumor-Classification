Course Project for MH4510: Statistical Learning and Data Mining

Data of interest: 
Brain Tumor MRI Scans (https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri)
, with classes labled as _No Tumor_, _Meningioma Tumor_, _Glioma Tumor_, and _Pituitary Tumor_.

Aim:
1. Build ML models to classify brain tumor types from MRI scans
2. Compare the efficiency and accuracy of ML models
3. Derive robust model in benefit of the medical society.

Models Tested:
1.	KNN
2.	Multi-class Support Vector Machine
3.	Random Forest
4.	Convolutional Neural Networks (ResNet34)
5.	Vision Transformer (ViT)
